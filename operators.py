'''OPERATORS'''
'''Arthimetic operators'''
#  a=int(input("enter a number: "))
# b = int(input("enter a number: "))
# print("The addition of",a+b)
# print("The subtraction of ",a-b)
# print("The multiplication of",a*b)
# print("The division of",a/b)
# print("The floor division of",a//b)
# print("The modular division of",a%b)
# print("The power of",a**b)

'''Logical operators'''
# a = 23
# b = 30
# c = a<b and b>a 
# print(c)
# d = 40
# e = 45
# f = d>e or e>d 
# print(f)
# a = 1
# print(not(a))
# a = 0
# print(not(a)) 

'''Relational operators'''
# a = int(input("enter a number: "))
# b = int(input("enter a number: "))
# print("The greater value", a>b)
# print("The lesser value", a<b)
# print("The greater than and equals too value",a>=b)
# print("The lesse than and equals too value",a<=b)
# print("the equals too value",a==b)
# print("the not equals too value",a!=b)

'''Membership operators'''
# x = ["apple", "banana", "jack", "kiwi"]
# print("pineapple" in x) 
# print("apple" in x)
# print("dragon" not in x)
# print("banana" not in x)

'''Identity operators'''
# x = [ 1,2,3]
# y = [4,5,6]
# z =x
# print(x is z)
# print(x is y)
# print(x is not y)
# print(z is not y)
